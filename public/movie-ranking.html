<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I really love Sci-Fi movies, and this, in particular, has an amazing performance by the actors, an excellent plot, and an amazing design.</p>

<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>One of the best plot I ever see in a movie.</p>

<h3>Groundhog Day</h3>
<p>Every time I see this movie it kept me thinking that we should appreciate every day and learn the most that we can, also help others.</p>
